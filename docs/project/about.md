## ABOUT `PROJECT`

This is an **Open-Source** project created with the intention of using it on
various projects that we're currently working on.

The idea for this project came from the fact that I was programming various
applications, I wanted the results that are shown in the terminal at the output
to be nice and colorful. I could have used packages already written for this,
but I wanted to try to write my own package and that's how it started.

## ABOUT `US`

Hello, my name is Marcin Różewski and I am the creator of this project.
Programming and 3D animation is my passion. I am a 3D Generalist and *Python*
Developer. I've been working on VFX and Game Development for the past 14 years
now.

I've been dealing with programming for a very long time. In elementary school,
I'm wrote many terminal applications in *Turbo Pascal* on my first desktop
computer that's have an Intel Celeron 333Mhz CPU and 16MB of RAM. When
I started college, I'm met *Python* in the first time and I fell in love with
it. Now we're use *Python* programming for many things like automation, web
development and 3D animation.

### VFX `STUDIO`

Our studio uses SideFX Houdini to create a visual effect like smoke, water,
cloth simulation, procedural 3D modeling and much more cool stuff. We can make
digital asset for Unreal Engine 4 and tweak parameter of the asset directly in
game engine. In this way, we're making perfect game assets with only these two
excellent pieces of software.

Our studio creates games, cinematic, commercial and we also create web and
desktop app.

To make 3D models, animation, motion design, sculpt and render we're use
Blender. This is a Open-Source Free Software and we love this great program
too. Blender has a very large community and is very well developed. You can
create amazing things in it.

We really like command line rendering, so much fun!

Also, we have experienced on Substance Painter with UDIM workflow, Zbrush,
Coat 3D, Nuke, Black Magic Davinci Resolve, Black Magic Fusion and many more
great software. We recently discovered a great software called Clarisse iFX.
On this software we do 3D layout and rendering. This software can handle off
the limit the biggest 3D scenes ever, without any display problems. Handle over
10 trylion polygon and no more lagging on 3D viewport, no more LOD level of
detail.

### APP `DEVELOPMENT`

Our studio also experienced in App Development. We're coding in Python, VEX,
C#, JavaScript, HTML and SQL. Development framework that we're using is
a Xamarin, Kivy, KivyMD, PySide2, PyQt5 and more. Our favorite coding software
IDE is Visual Studio Code and of course all code commits with GIT source
control.

We expanded our experience in Cloud Computing like Linux Ubuntu in AWS, S3,
Spot Instance, Azure, Oracle, Google Cloud, Real Time DataBase in Firebase.
