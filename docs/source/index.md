# MDSANIMA DEVELOPMENT

Welcome to ``MDSANIMA DEVELOPMENT`` documentation site.

```{important}
This organization mainly deals with ``Python`` programming. Sometimes we also
code in other languages like ``JavaScript``, ``HTML``, ``Bash Scripting``
and ``PowerShell``.

We also use the latest technologies Realtime Database, Cloud Servers
or Machine Learning. We deliver apps and plugins as containers in Docker Compose
for easy deployment. We know Linux with better security. Every day we learn
something new.
